Penetration Testing Report: Metasploitable 2
Overview
This repository contains a detailed penetration testing report for an intentionally vulnerable Metasploitable system. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical penetration testing skills in a controlled and ethical environment.

Objective
The objective of this assessment was to identify, exploit, and document vulnerabilities in the target system, providing insights into potential security risks and recommended mitigations.

Tools and Techniques
The penetration testing process involved the use of various tools and techniques, including:

Reconnaissance: Nmap, whois, and netcat
Exploitation: Metasploit Framework, manual exploitation scripts
Post-Exploitation: Privilege escalation, persistence, and lateral movement
Reporting: Detailed documentation and risk analysis
Methodology
The penetration testing was conducted following industry-standard methodologies:

Information Gathering: Identified open ports, services, and configurations.
Vulnerability Scanning: Analyzed for known vulnerabilities using tools and manual testing.
Exploitation: Demonstrated exploitation techniques, including telnet, ssh.
Post-Exploitation: Highlighted potential impacts such as data access or privilege escalation.
Reporting: Created a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations.
